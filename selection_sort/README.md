# Selection sort algorithm

This project implements a selection sort algorithm in Go. The selection sort algorithm is used to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

### Big O Notation
#### Time Complexity: O(n^2)
The selection sort algorithm has a quadratic time complexity because it involves nested loops: one to iterate over each element and another to find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array.
#### Space Complexity: O(1)  
The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, as it only requires a few additional variables for the indices and the minimum element.
